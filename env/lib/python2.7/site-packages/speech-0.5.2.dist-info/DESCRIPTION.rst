speech.py
------------

  Allows your Windows python program to:
    * get the text spoken by the user when prompted (a la raw_input())
    * execute a callback when certain phrases are heard
    * execute a callback when any understandable text is heard
    * have different callbacks for different groups of phrases
    * convert text to speech.

Example
=======

  Showing speaking out loud, a simple input, and listening for all
  recognizable words.
  ::

    import speech
    import time

    response = speech.input("Say something, please.")
    speech.say("You said " + response)

    def callback(phrase, listener):
        if phrase == "goodbye":
            listener.stoplistening()
        speech.say(phrase)

    listener = speech.listenforanything(callback)
    while listener.islistening():
        time.sleep(.5)

Requirements
============

  Requires Windows XP or Vista, and Python 2.4 or 2.5.  If you use
  Windows Vista, you'll need to say "start listening" if Speech
  Recognition is not awake.

  In addition to easy_installing speech.py, you'll need pywin32
  (`for Python 2.5 <http://tinyurl.com/5ezco9>`__ or
  `for Python 2.4 <http://tinyurl.com/5uzpox>`__); and if you're on XP,
  you'll need the Microsoft Speech kit (installer
  `here <http://tinyurl.com/br8ysh>`__).
